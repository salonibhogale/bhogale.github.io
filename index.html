<p>Welcome! My name is Saloni Bhogale, and I am pursuing an M.S. in <b> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://polisci.wisc.edu/">Statistics (Applied Statistics)</a></b> and a PhD in <b> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://polisci.wisc.edu/">Political Science</a></b> at the <b> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.wisc.edu/">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a></b>.
<p>
  

 My work is focused on the political economy of development and political institutions. I am working on projects that examine the effects of term lengths on legislator performance, the effects of judicial (in)efficiency on economic development and the impact of affirmative action. Methodologically, I am interested in learning more about how social scientists use and apply machine learning - particularly, I am working on a project that evaluates the effectiveness and validity of using word embeddings to measure group-level biases in textual data.
  
  

I also co-coordinate <b> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://sites.google.com/wisc.edu/cpcwisc/">the Comparative Politics Colloquium</a></b> â€” a workshop which meets weekly and invites speakers, faculty members, and graduate students to present their work and receive feedback. </p>

<p>I am interested in causal inference because the method can be used to understand whether variation in efficiency of courts can have an impact on economic development. While it may not be possible to experimentally manipulate 'court quality' by randomly assigning 'better' courts to some areas, I am hoping that the tools from causal inference can be leveraged to credibly establish the broader economic effects of weak institutions, particularly judicial ineffiency.</p>

<h3> The Question </h3>

<p>The quality of a country's judiciary has far-reaching consequences, as it plays a key role as the arbitrator of justice and is the institution that protects the rights of citizens. However, there remains large variation in the <i>ability</i> of courts to perform this mandate, especially in developing countries. </p>

<p>Of particular importance is institutional diversity, which can affect the fairness, access and legitimacy of an institution.</p>

<p> This motivates the question: What are the effects of affirmative action on judicial efficiency, and diversity within the judiciary? </p>

<h3> Background </h3>

<p> Gender inequality in developing countries remains an <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-economics-080614-115404">important issue</a>. The societal balance is tilted in favor of the male population - in the labor market, health, education and personal autonomy. </p>
<p> Further, gender-based preferences thus result in enrollment gaps, wage gaps and other forms of discrimination. Discriminatory gender norms are persistent and get carried over to public and political institutions, and thus policies are instituted to address this societal issue.</p>
<p> However, there remains little systematic analysis of affirmative action policies in the judiciary, and I hope to address this research gap through my work. </p>

<h3> Random variables</h3>

<p> Below, I describe the random variables that I will use to model the problem:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Treatment: </b> Quotas, an indicator variable that takes the value 1 if a court is located in an area with affirmative action for women, and 0 otherwise.</li>
  <li><b>Outcome 1: </b>Representation, measured by the number of female judges practicing in the court</li>
  <li><b>Outcome 2: </b>Judicial efficiency, measured by the average time taken to resolve a case in a given District Court</li>
  <li><b>Outcome 3: </b>Pipeline effects, measured by the number of women attempting judicial service examninations.  </li>
  <li><b>Control 1: </b>Time, a dummy to indicate whether the observation is before or after the quota policy is in place</li>
  <li><b>Control 2: </b> Court workload</li>
  <li><b>Other controls:</b> controlling for court and area characteristics</li>
</ul>

<h3> The Causal Effect </h3>
<p> Through this project, I plan to recover the average treatment effect</p>

<p>Mathematically, we can write: </p>
<p> <i> E[Y(a) - Y(a')]</i> which is also known as the average causal effect </p>
<p>Here, Y can be one of outcomes 1 to 3, and a is the treatment, whether the court is in an area with affirmative action or not.</p>


<h3> Working Hypothesis </h3>

<p><b>Hypothesis 1:</b> Quotas lead to an increase in the number of female judges practicing in District Courts</p>
<p><b>Hypothesis 2:</b> Quotas lead to no change in judicial efficiency</p>
<p><b>Hypothesis 3:</b> Quotas lead to an increase in the number of women attempting the state judicial services examinations.</p>
